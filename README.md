# Solana Wallet Grind

A utility for grinding for Solana wallet addresses starting with a specific sequence of letters.

See this [forum topic](https://forums.solana.com/t/fancy-solana-addresses/3615?u=zicklag) for more explanation.

## Install

Requires [Deno] and the Solana CLI to be installed. Then run:

```
deno install --allow-run=solana-keygen --name solana-wallet-grind https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zicklag/solana-wallet-grind/master/mod.ts
```

Deno automatically sandboxes the script to prevent it access to your system. This means things like disk and network access must be granted explicitly. The deno install command above only grants the script access to run the `solana-keygen` command, so you know that it can't access your network or disk or do anything else on your computer other than use the `solana-keygen` command. This is great for security!

## Usage

```
$ solana-wallet-grind --help
DESCRIPTION:
  Grind for Solana vanity pubkeys
OPTIONS:
  --help, -h
    Show help
  --startsWith, -s <text>
    What the public key should start with
  --tasks, -t <number> [default: 6]
    How many async tasks to use to grind. It may actually be useful to set this higher than your number of CPU cores, because these don't correspond exactly to CPU threads
  --words, -w <number> [default: 12]
    How many words to have in the seed phrase
  --caseInsensitive, -i
```

## Performance

This tool is _waaayyyy_ slower than Solana's `solana-keygen grind` command, because it spawns a bunch of `solana-keygen` tasks over-and-over, each of which have to start a whole other system process. It would be much faster if I wrote a Rust version, but I started with the Deno version because it's cool that I can write a script that you don't have to trust as much with Deno's security measures preventing the script from accessing the network and sending your seed phrases somewhere etc. I'll just contribute to the official `solana-keygen` tool so that it's fast and in Rust if enough people actually want this feature! ( seriously, open an issue if you really want to use this so that I know there's a need for it. )

## Tips üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If this was useful to you I‚Äôd really appreciate a tip, no matter how small, in whatever Solana or SPL tokens you prefer. It will help me spend time helping people on the Solana forum and learning more about crypto. My wallet address is `9ftYTyetEXtLtDkhfRF8bCWGfKZqiYmx2HDZDTogZh6A`. Thanks!
